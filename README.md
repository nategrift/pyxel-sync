# PyxelSync

## Description

The PyxelSync Project was a journey to explore the entire life-cycle of an IoT device. I was responsible for every aspect of this project. It began with the development of a web application that enables users to add devices, create animations or pixel art, and subsequently upload these to a device â€“ a PyxelSync Device. The next step involved creating a server that acts as a repository for this data and facilitates communication between the app and the IoT device. The final piece of this project was the construction of a colored LED matrix IoT device, which utilizes Wi-Fi to retrieve the latest animation assigned to it and displays it on the LEDs. In this post, I will refer to the actual IoT device I developed as PyxelSync.
